# Task 03 — CRM System for a UI/UX Agency

## Project Overview

This project involves designing a structured CRM system for a growing UI/UX agency.

The objective was to build an operational system that centralizes lead management, client intelligence, project governance, revenue tracking, and task execution.

Unlike consumer applications, B2B systems require clarity, density control, and structured hierarchy.

## Problem Statement

Creative agencies often struggle with:

- Fragmented lead tracking
- Spreadsheet-based revenue monitoring
- Poor project visibility
- Missed client follow-ups
- Lack of centralized operational overview

As agencies scale, operational complexity increases.

---

## System Architecture

The CRM system is structured into five core modules:

- Lead Pipeline
- Client Intelligence Dashboard
- Project Management
- Task Execution System
- Revenue & Reporting Overview

Each module functions independently while contributing to a unified operational system.

## UX Strategy

- Modular system design
- High information density with scannability
- Minimal visual noise
- Consistent grid-based layout

---

## Design Principles Applied
