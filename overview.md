# Task 01 — UI/UX Case Study  

## Project Overview  

Task 01 focuses on redesigning the website of **Brotomotiv**, a premium automotive detailing and repair brand based in Pune.

While the brand identity was bold and confident, the website experience felt cluttered and heavy.  
The objective was to improve clarity, reduce friction, and guide users toward booking an inspection — without changing the core visual identity.

## Problem Statement  

The existing website faced several usability challenges:

- Too many navigation options  
- Dense content with low scannability  
- Unstructured service presentation  
- No pricing clarity  
- A 12+ field enquiry form  
- Generic CTA language  

Although visually strong, the experience lacked clear direction and conversion focus.

## Design Approach  

Instead of redesigning the brand visually, the focus was on restructuring the user journey.

The experience was simplified into a clear flow:

Homepage → Service Page → Enquiry Page  

Each page had a defined role:

- Homepage → Introduce & guide  
- Service Page → Build trust & clarity  
- Enquiry Page → Reduce friction & convert  

Key improvements included:

- Cleaner service presentation  
- Benefit-first content structure  
- Clear process breakdown  
- Pricing anchor introduction  
- Enquiry form reduced from 12+ fields to 5 essential inputs  
- Strong, action-driven CTA: “Book Inspection”

## Outcome  

The redesign shifts the experience from passive browsing to guided decision-making.

By reducing cognitive load and improving structure, the website becomes clearer, more focused, and more action-oriented — while preserving Brotomotiv’s bold identity.
